	abstract = {Observing magnetic star-planet interactions (SPIs) offers promise for determining the magnetic fields of exoplanets. Models of sub-Alfvénic SPIs predict that terrestrial planets in close-in orbits around M dwarfs can induce detectable stellar radio emission, manifesting as bursts of strongly polarized coherent radiation observable at specific planet orbital positions. Here we present 2-4 GHz detections of coherent radio bursts on the slowly rotating M dwarf YZ Ceti, which hosts a compact system of terrestrial planets, the innermost of which orbits with a two-day period. Two coherent bursts occur at similar orbital phases of YZ Ceti b, suggestive of an enhanced probability of bursts near that orbital phase. We model the system's magnetospheric environment in the context of sub-Alfvénic SPIs and determine that YZ Ceti b can plausibly power the observed flux densities of the radio detections. However, we cannot rule out stellar magnetic activity without a well-characterized rate of non-planet-induced coherent radio bursts on slow rotators. YZ Ceti is therefore a candidate radio SPI system, with unique promise as a target for long-term monitoring.},

We present our measurement of the system's projected orbital obliquity via two spectroscopic transit observations using the CHIRON spectroscopic facility.

With a value of \${\textbar}{\textbackslash}lambda{\textbar} = 5.8{\textasciicircum}\{+2.8{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}circ\}\_\{-5.7\}\$, it is unlikely that this well-aligned system is the result of a high eccentricity driven migration history.

Our analysis shows the feasibility of such measurements for young and very active stars.},

Previous low-frequency searches for radio emitting stellar systems have lacked the sensitivity to detect the general population, instead largely focusing on targeted studies of anomalously active stars. Here we present 19 detections of coherent radio emission associated with known M{\textasciitilde}dwarfs from a blind flux-limited low-frequency survey. Our detections show that coherent radio emission is ubiquitous across the M{\textasciitilde}dwarf main sequence, and that the radio luminosity is independent of known coronal and chromospheric activity indicators. While plasma emission can generate the low-frequency emission from the most chromospherically active stars of our sample, the origin of the radio emission from the most quiescent sources is yet to be ascertained. Large-scale analogues of the magnetospheric processes seen in gas-giant planets likely drive the radio emission associated with these quiescent stars. The slowest-rotating stars of this sample are candidate systems to search for star-planet interaction signatures.},

	abstract = {Low-frequency (ν ≲ 150 MHz) stellar radio emission is expected to originate in the outer corona at heights comparable to and larger than the stellar radius. Such emission from the Sun has been used to study coronal structure, mass ejections and space-weather conditions around the planets1. Searches for low-frequency emission from other stars have detected only a single active flare star2 that is not representative of the wider stellar population. Here we report the detection of low-frequency radio emission from a quiescent star, GJ 1151—a member of the most common stellar type (red dwarf or spectral class M) in the Galaxy. The characteristics of the emission are similar to those of planetary auroral emissions3 (for example, Jupiter’s decametric emission), suggesting a coronal structure dominated by a global magnetosphere with low plasma density. Our results show that large-scale currents that power radio aurorae operate over a vast range of mass and atmospheric composition, ranging from terrestrial planets to main-sequence stars. The Poynting flux required to produce the observed radio emission cannot be generated by GJ 1151’s slow rotation, but can originate in a sub-Alfvénic interaction of its magnetospheric plasma with a short-period exoplanet. The emission properties are consistent with theoretical expectations4–7 for interaction with an Earth-size planet in an approximately one- to five-day-long orbit.},

	abstract = {There have recently been detections of radio emission from low-mass stars, some of which are indicative of star-planet interactions. Motivated by these exciting new results, in this paper we present Alfvén wave-driven stellar wind models of the two active planet-hosting M dwarfs Prox Cen and AU Mic. Our models incorporate large-scale photospheric magnetic field maps reconstructed using the Zeeman-Doppler imaging method. We obtain a mass-loss rate of \$0.25{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}dot\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{ M\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ for the wind of Prox Cen. For the young dwarf AU Mic, we explore two cases: a low and a high mass-loss rate. Depending on the properties of the Alfvén waves that heat the corona in our wind models, we obtain mass-loss rates of 27 and \$590{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}dot\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{ M\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ for AU Mic. We use our stellar wind models to assess the generation of electron cyclotron maser instability emission in both systems, through a mechanism analogous to the sub-Alfvénic Jupiter-Io interaction. For Prox Cen, we do not find any feasible scenario where the planet can induce radio emission in the star's corona, as the planet orbits too far from the star in the super-Alfvénic regime. However, in the case that AU Mic has a stellar wind mass-loss rate of \$27{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}dot\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{ M\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$, we find that both planets b and c in the system can induce radio emission from {\textasciitilde}10 MHz to 3 GHz in the corona of the host star for the majority of their orbits, with peak flux densities of {\textasciitilde}10 mJy. Detection of such radio emission would allow us to place an upper limit on the mass-loss rate of the star.},

In the case of a non-axisymmetric field, the time modulation of the energy release is multiperiodic and can be easily confused with the intrinsic stellar variability. We apply our theory to the systems with some reported evidence of star-planet magnetic interaction finding a dissipated power at least one order of magnitude smaller than that emitted by the chromospheric hot spots. The phase lags between the planets and the hot spots are reproduced by our models in all the cases except for υ And. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: The chromospheric hot spots rotating in phase with the planets cannot be explained by the energy dissipation produced by the interaction between stellar and planetary fields as considered by our models and require a different mechanism.},

	abstract = {In many star-planet systems discovered so far, the innermost planet orbits within only a few stellar radii. In these systems, planets could become in situ probes of the extended stellar magnetic field. Because they disturb the field as they move, they are expected to trigger flares in the corona. Potential differences to the energies and morphologies of intrinsic flares are poorly constrained. However, as we expect planet-induced flares to correlate with the planet's orbital period, we can identify them from a clustering of flares in phase with the planet's orbit. We used the excellent phase coverage from Kepler and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite to find flaring star-planet systems, compile a catalogue of all their flares, and measure how much they cluster in orbital phase. In the 1811 searched systems, we found 25 single stars with three or more flares each. We quantified the significance of the clustering in each system, and compared it against the theoretically expected power of magnetic interaction that leads to planet-induced flaring. Most systems do not show any clustering, consistent with low expected power. Those we expect to show clustering fall on two branches. An inactive one, without any signs of clustering, and a tentative active one, where the clustering becomes more pronounced as the expected power of interaction increases. The flares in HIP 67522 are prominently clustered (p {\textless} 0.006). This young hot Jupiter system is the most promising candidate for magnetic star-planet interaction in our sample.},
